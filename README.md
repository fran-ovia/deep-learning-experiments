# Deep Learning Experiments

* Repository of small projects I do to play around with deep learning tools and experiment on some ideas.
* Requirementes depend on the project itself. I'm generally using python, numpy, pandas, jupyter, gensim and tensorflow

# How to use it?

**Each project has a unique directory. Simply download such directory and use it!**

# Vectorizing Declensions - On word embeddings for declension-intensive languages

Thoughts on the difficult but critical task to generate good embeddings when processing languages that make extensive use of declensions. Experiments on how such embeddings could be created without multiplying the requirements on corpora size and processing power.
This is implemented with jupyter notebooks. Dependencies are python 3, pandas and gensim.
