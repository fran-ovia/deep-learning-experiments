# Deep Learning Experiments

* Repository of experiments made to play with Deep Learning technology and test some ideas.
* Requirementes depend on the experiment itself. Currently python, numpy, pandas, jupyter, gensim and tensorflow

# How to use?

**Each experiment has a unique directory. Simply download that directory and use it!**

# Vectorizing Declensions - On word embeddings for declension-intensive languages

Thoughts on the difficult but critical task to generate good embeddings when processing languages that make extensive use of declensions. Experiments on how such embeddings could be created without multiplying the requirements on corpora size and processing power.
This is implemented with jupyter notebooks. Dependencies are python, pandas and gensim.
